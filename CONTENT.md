## Main Heading

**Helping People Build Extraordinary Things**

## The Vision

In a world where information grows exponentially, the divide widens between those who can harness it and those overwhelmed by it. I explore the intersection of human cognition and artificial intelligence, creating frameworks that amplify our innate capabilities rather than replacing them. This is about the renaissance of human potential through transformative cognitive acceleration.

## Current Explorations

-   Cognitive frameworks that transform unfamiliarity into capability
-   The polymath advantage in an age of hyper-specialization
-   Mental models for accelerated learning across any domain
